Martin Heidegger ( ; ] ; 26 September 188926 May 1976) was a German philosopher and a seminal thinker in the Continental tradition and philosophical hermeneutics. According to the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", he is \"widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century\". Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" cautions, \"his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification\". Roger Henry Pocklington Senhouse (1899 \u2013 1970) was an English publisher and translator, and a member of the Bloomsbury Group of writers, intellectuals, and artists. The private letters of openly gay writer Lytton Strachey reveal that Roger Senhouse was his last lover, with whom he had a secretly sado-masochistic relationship in the early 1930s. Thrownness (German: \"Geworfenheit\" ) is a concept introduced by German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) to describe humans' individual existences as \"being thrown\" (\"geworfen\") into the world. \"Geworfen\" denotes the arbitrary or inscrutable nature of \"Dasein\" that connects the past with the present. The past, through Being-toward-Death, becomes a part of \"Dasein\". Awareness and acknowledgment of the arbitrariness of \"Dasein\" is characterized as a state of \"thrown-ness\" in the present with all its attendant frustrations, sufferings, and demands that one does not choose, such as social conventions or ties of kinship and duty. The very fact of one's own existence is a manifestation of thrown-ness. The idea of the past as a matrix not chosen, but at the same time not utterly binding or deterministic, results in the notion of \"Geworfenheit\"\u2014a kind of alienation that human beings struggle against, and that leaves a paradoxical opening for freedom:\n\nClaim: \nThrownness is a concept introduced by Argentine philosopher.

A large part of the knowledge about these organic molecules has come from the study of \"E. coli\" ribosomes. All ribosomal proteins have been isolated and many specific antibodies have been produced. These, together with electronic microscopy and the use of certain reactives, have allowed for the determination of the topography of the proteins in the ribosome. \"E. coli\", other bacteria and Archaea have a 30S small subunit and a 50S large subunit, whereas humans and yeasts have a 40S small subunit and a 60S large subunit. Equivalent subunits are frequently numbered differently between bacteria, Archaea, yeasts and humans. More recently, a near-complete (near)atomic picture of the ribosomal proteins is emerging from the latest high-resolution cryo-EM data (including PDB ID: 5AFI). The ribosome ( ) is a complex molecular machine, found within all living cells, that serves as the site of biological protein synthesis (translation). Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins (r-protein or rProtein). The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the \"translational apparatus\". SINEs or Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements are sequences of non-coding DNA present at high frequencies in various eukaryotic genomes. They are a class of retrotransposons, DNA elements that amplify themselves throughout eukaryotic genomes, often through RNA intermediates. Short-interspersed nuclear elements are characterized by their size and method of retrotransposition. The literature differs on the length of the SINEs but there is a general consensus that they often range in length from about 100 to 700 base pairs (more or less, arbitrary cut-offs). Short-interspersed nuclear elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III which is known to transcribe ribosomal RNA and tRNA, two types of RNA vital to ribosomal assembly and mRNA translation. SINEs, like tRNAs and many small-nuclear RNAs possess an internal promoter and thus are transcribed differently than most protein-coding genes. In other words, short-interspersed nuclear elements have their key promoter elements within the transcribed region itself. Though transcribed by RNA polymerase III, SINEs and other genes possessing internal promoters, recruit different transcriptional machinery and factors than genes possessing upstream promoters.\n\nClaim: \nThe sub-units that use two types of RNA are major components that make up the unit consisting of Ribosomal protein.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Dign\u0101ga's work laid the groundwork for the development of deductive logic in India and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (Pramana). According to Georges B Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian \"epistemological turn\" and became the \"standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet.\" Dign\u0101ga's thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti and also Hindu thinkers of the Nyaya school. Dign\u0101ga's epistemology accepted only \"perception\" (pratyaksa) and \"inference\" (anum\u0101\u1e47a) are valid instruments of knowledge. The development of Indian logic dates back to the \"anviksiki\" of Medhatithi Gautama (c. 7th century BCE) the Sanskrit grammar rules of P\u0101\u1e47ini (c. 5th century BCE); the Vaisheshika school's analysis of atomism (c. 2nd century BCE); the analysis of inference by Gotama (c. 2nd century), founder of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy; and the tetralemma of Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE). Indian logic stands as one of the three original traditions of logic, alongside the Greek and the Chinese logic. The Indian tradition continued to develop through to early modern times, in the form of the Navya-Ny\u0101ya school of logic. The Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da Gautama , and the foundational text of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown, but variously estimated between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE. The text may have been composed by more than one author, over a period of time. The text consists of five books, with two chapters in each book, with a cumulative total of 528 aphoristic sutras, about rules of reason, logic, epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nClaim: \nThere are five books in the text composed by the founder Nyaya school of Buddhist philosophy, which is used in the development of the theory co-founded by Buddhist scholar Dign\u0101ga.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The opera is revived occasionally, but has not yet found a place in repertory. Harry Gustaf Nikolai G\u00e4dda, known professionally as Nicolai Gedda (11 July 1925 \u2013 8 January 2017), was a Swedish operatic tenor. Debuting in 1951, Gedda had a long and successful career in opera until the age of 77 in June 2003, when he made his final operatic recording. Skilled at languages, he performed operas in French, Russian, German, Italian, English, Czech, and Swedish, as well as one in Latin. In January 1958, he created the part of Anatol in the world premiere of the American opera \"Vanessa\" at the Metropolitan Opera. Having made some two hundred recordings, Gedda is one of the most widely recorded opera singers in history. His singing is best known for its beauty of tone, vocal control, and musical perception. Vanessa is an American opera in three (originally four) acts by Samuel Barber, opus 32, with an original English libretto by Gian-Carlo Menotti.

Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition. The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\". The Griffon Bruxellois or Brussels Griffon is a breed of toy dog, named for their city of origin: Brussels, Belgium. The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs.\n\nClaim: \nEnglish Mastiff is many pounds heavier than a breed that Canine Chiari-like malformation is widespread in.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The clerk in some cases has a ceremonial role. A clerk may also advise the speaker or members on parliamentary procedure, acting in American parlance as a \"parliamentarian\". The Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed. As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution.

Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list.

Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 to 30 BC. They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt. The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele, found in 1799, inscribed with three versions of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy\u00a0V.

As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nClaim: \nThe rule of the dynasty that was active when the stone was inscribed was 275 years long.

Vermeer was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime. He evidently was not wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings. The Lacemaker is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632\u20131675), completed around 1669\u20131670 and held in the Louvre, Paris. The work shows a young woman dressed in a yellow shawl, holding up a pair of bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is making her bobbin lace. At 24.5\u00a0cm x 21\u00a0cm (9.6 in x 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings, but in many ways one of his most abstract and unusual. The canvas used was cut from the same bolt as that used for \"A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals\", and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.

Perhaps his best-known roles were Alf Larkin in \"The Larkins\" and Professor Kokintz in \"The Mouse that Roared\" (1959) and its sequel \"The Mouse on the Moon\" (1963). Summer Holiday is a British CinemaScope and Technicolor musical film featuring singer Cliff Richard. The film was directed by Peter Yates (his debut), produced by Kenneth Harper.

The cast includes Lauri Peters, Melvyn Hayes, Teddy Green, Jeremy Bulloch, Una Stubbs, Pamela Hart, Jacqueline Daryl, Lionel Murton, Madge Ryan, David Kossoff, Nicholas Phipps, Ron Moody and The Shadows. Herbert Ross choreographed the musical numbers. \"The Next Time\" backed with \"Bachelor Boy\" was the first of three number one hit singles from the Cliff Richard musical, \"Summer Holiday\". Both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, and the release is viewed retrospectively as a double A-side single. However, technically double A sides were not regarded as such until 1965, so \"The Next Time\" was pressed as the A-side, with \"Bachelor Boy\" the B-side (written by Bruce Welch and Cliff Richard).

Its rich history also comes from its native inhabitants and outside influence. Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until the secrets of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and help of the Rosetta Stone. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the other Seven Wonders, is gone. The Library of Alexandria was the only one of its kind for centuries. The Ptolemaic dynasty (Ancient\u00a0Greek: \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 , \"Ptolemaioi\"), sometimes also known as the Lagids or Lagidae (Ancient\u00a0Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 , \"Lagidai\", after Lagus, Ptolemy I's father), was a Macedonian Greek royal family, which ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt during the Hellenistic period. Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 to 30 BC. They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt. The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele, found in 1799, inscribed with three versions of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy\u00a0V. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nClaim: \nThe rule of the dynasty that was active when the stone was inscribed was nearly three centuries long.

He is the older brother of fellow actor Jiang Wu. Henri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp (] ; 28 July 1887 \u2013 2 October 1968) was a French-American painter, sculptor, chess player and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, conceptual art and Dada, although he was careful about his use of the term Dada and was not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art; and he had a seminal influence on the development of conceptual art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (like Henri Matisse) as \"retinal\" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to use art to serve the mind. Prelude to a Broken Arm (En pr\u00e9vision du bras cass\u00e9 in French) is a 1915 sculpture by Dada artist Marcel Duchamp that consisted of a regular snow shovel with the title and \"from Marcel Duchamp 1915\" painted on the handle. An antidote to what he called \"retinal art\", this sculpture was the second of a series of sculptures that he called \"ready-mades\", the most famous of which is his 1917 \"Fontaine\" (\"Fountain\"). At the time, the term \"ready-made\" referred to manufactured goods as opposed to handmade goods, but Duchamp used the term to describe \"an ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist\". The original was hung from a wire in the studio and has since been lost. It is believed that the shovel was mistaken for an ordinary snow shovel and was removed to move snow off the sidewalks of Chicago. A replica of the sculpture is on display at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nClaim: \nI would be more worried about playing a chess game against the artist that made Prelude to a Broken Arm, than Jiang Wen.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".

Originally published in Arabic in 1966, it has since been translated into more than twenty languages. Salih was fluent in both English and Arabic, but chose to pen this novel in Arabic. The English translation was published in 1969 as part of the influential Heinemann African Writers Series. The novel is a counter narrative to \"Heart of Darkness\". It was described by Edward Said as one of the six great novels in Arabic literature. In 2001 it was selected by a panel of Arab writers and critics as the most important Arab novel of the twentieth century. Waiting for Happiness (original title: Heremakono) is a 2002 drama film written and directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. Main characters are a student, who has returned to his home in Nouadhibou, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women. The film is characterized by a succession of scenes of the daily life of the characters which are unique to their particular African and Arab cultures, while borrowing from tropes of Tayeb Saleh's Season of Migration to the North (\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644). The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot, while the structure of the film hangs on a series of mundane but visually arresting moments, many of which are repeated in other works in Abderrahmane Sissako's opus, including scenes at a barber shop and a photo booth, also present in his earlier La Vie Sur Terre and later Timbuktu. The film presents typical Mauritanian moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor, which are experienced by groups socially divided from each other, such as Bidhan women drinking tea and gossiping, West African migrants passing through Mauritania to get to Europe (and finding an unsuccessful comrade washed ashore). The young protagonist who has returned interacts with all of these groups as an outsider, as he struggles to remember even his own Hassaniya Arabic dialect, but prefers instead French. Many of the themes and characters presage Sissako's 2014 film Timbuktu, and both explore liminal Sahel identities authentically situated in everyday life. Waiting for Happiness premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.\n\nClaim: \nThe Tayeb Saleh novel that Waiting for Happiness borrows tropes from, is a counter narrative to a novella by the Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation. The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942\u20131945). The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. The Battle of Saipan was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on the island of Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 15 June to 9 July 1944. The Allied invasion fleet embarking the expeditionary forces left Pearl Harbor on 5 June 1944, the day before Operation Overlord in Europe was launched. The U.S. 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the Army's 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, defeated the 43rd Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito. The Japanese 20mm Cannon Blockhouse is one of many relics of World War II on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is a concrete blockhouse, semi-circular in shape with a diameter of about 6 m . Its walls are 1.22 m thick with four firing ports large enough to accommodate 20mm cannons, originally equipped with steel sliding shutters. A steel door 25 mm thick provides access to the structure at the rear, sheltered by a concrete wall and covered defensively by a machine gun port. The blockhouse is located near the center of what is locally called Big Agingan Beach (Unai Dankulo Agingan), on the south coast of the island, about 20 m from the shore. It was built in some haste by the Japanese forces defending Saipan in 1944, and was captured by Allied forces early in the Battle of Saipan.\n\nClaim: \nBoth this engagement, in which the Japanese 20mm Cannon Blockhouse was captured in the early stages of, and the Battle of Manila were fought by forces from the same country.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Olympus-1 was a communications satellite built by British Aerospace for the European Space Agency. At the time of its launch on 12 July 1989, it was the largest civilian telecomms satellite ever built, and sometimes known as \"LargeSat\" or \"L-Sat\". The satellite had a series of unfortunate accidents in orbit and went out of service on 11/12 August 1993. The first accident was the loss of ability to articulate the satellite's solar arrays. This was later followed by the loss of an onboard gyro during the height of the Perseid meteor shower. The satellite spun out of control and efforts to stabilize it resulted in the expenditure of the majority of its fuel. Subsequently, it was moved to a GEO disposal orbit and was put out of commission.

Originally published in Arabic in 1966, it has since been translated into more than twenty languages. Salih was fluent in both English and Arabic, but chose to pen this novel in Arabic. The English translation was published in 1969 as part of the influential Heinemann African Writers Series. The novel is a counter narrative to \"Heart of Darkness\". It was described by Edward Said as one of the six great novels in Arabic literature. In 2001 it was selected by a panel of Arab writers and critics as the most important Arab novel of the twentieth century. Waiting for Happiness (original title: Heremakono) is a 2002 drama film written and directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. Main characters are a student, who has returned to his home in Nouadhibou, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women. The film is characterized by a succession of scenes of the daily life of the characters which are unique to their particular African and Arab cultures, while borrowing from tropes of Tayeb Saleh's Season of Migration to the North (\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644). The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot, while the structure of the film hangs on a series of mundane but visually arresting moments, many of which are repeated in other works in Abderrahmane Sissako's opus, including scenes at a barber shop and a photo booth, also present in his earlier La Vie Sur Terre and later Timbuktu. The film presents typical Mauritanian moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor, which are experienced by groups socially divided from each other, such as Bidhan women drinking tea and gossiping, West African migrants passing through Mauritania to get to Europe (and finding an unsuccessful comrade washed ashore). The young protagonist who has returned interacts with all of these groups as an outsider, as he struggles to remember even his own Hassaniya Arabic dialect, but prefers instead French. Many of the themes and characters presage Sissako's 2014 film Timbuktu, and both explore liminal Sahel identities authentically situated in everyday life. Waiting for Happiness premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.\n\nClaim: \nThe Tayeb Saleh novel that Waiting for Happiness borrows tropes from, is a counter narrative to a novella by the Ryukyuan-British novelist Joseph Conrad.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward\u00a0I (1272\u20131307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c.\u00a01360 during the reign of Edward III. Apart from the Rolls of Ol\u00e9ron, the earliest statute referred to is the \"Liber memorandorum\" (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London. Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots (Latin: \"Malleus Scotorum\" ), was King of England from 1272 to 1307. He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.

It was initially edited by Raymond A. Palmer, who was also the editor of \"Amazing Stories\", Ziff-Davis's other science fiction title. The first nine issues were in bedsheet format, but in June 1940 the magazine switched to a standard pulp size. It was almost cancelled at the end of 1940, but the October 1940 issue enjoyed unexpectedly good sales, helped by a strong cover by J. Allen St. John for Robert Moore Williams' \"Jongor of Lost Land\". By May 1941 the magazine was on a regular monthly schedule. Historians of science fiction consider that Palmer was unable to maintain a consistently high standard of fiction, but \"Fantastic Adventures\" soon developed a reputation for light-hearted and whimsical stories. Much of the material was written by a small group of writers under both their own names and house names. The cover art, like those of many other pulps of the era, focused on beautiful women in melodramatic action scenes. One regular cover artist was H.W. McCauley, whose glamorous \"MacGirl\" covers were popular with the readers, though the emphasis on depictions of attractive and often partly clothed women did draw some objections. Kenneth A. Arnold (March 29, 1915 \u2013 January 16, 1984) was an American aviator and businessman. He is best known for making what is generally considered the first widely reported unidentified flying object sighting in the United States, after claiming to have seen nine unusual objects flying in tandem near Mount Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947. Raymond Arthur Palmer (August 1, 1910 \u2013 August 15, 1977) was an American editor of \"Amazing Stories\" from 1938 through 1949, when he left publisher Ziff-Davis to publish and edit \"Fate Magazine\", and eventually many other magazines and books through his own publishing houses, including Amherst Press and Palmer Publications. In addition to magazines such as \"Mystic,\" \"Search,\" and 'Flying Saucers,\" he published numerous spirtualist books, including \"\", as well as several books related to flying saucers, including \"The Coming of the Saucers,\" co-written by Palmer with Kenneth Arnold. Palmer was also a prolific author of science fiction and fantasy stories, many of which were published under pseudonyms. World UFO Day is an awareness day for people to gather together and watch the skies for unidentified flying objects. The day is celebrated by some on June 24, and others on July 2. June 24 is the date that aviator Kenneth Arnold reported what is generally considered to be the first widely reported unidentified flying object sighting in the United States, while July 2 commemorates the supposed UFO crash in the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident.\n\nClaim: \nThe first editor of Fantastic Adventures was a co-writer for \"The Coming of the Saucers\".

Ford released the original model in 2000 for the 2001 model year\u2014a model jointly developed and released with Mazda of Japan\u2014who took a lead in the engineering of the two models and sold their version as the Mazda Tribute. Although the Escape and Tribute share the same underpinnings constructed from the Ford CD2 platform (based on Mazda GF underpinnings), the only panels common to the two vehicles are the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base inline-four engine, with Ford providing the optional V6. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the Ford Courier in the 1970s. Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the Ford Maverick, replacing the previous Nissan-sourced model. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury Mercury division released a rebadged version called the Mercury Mariner, sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a hybrid drivetrain option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only. The Mazda Capella is a mid-size car that was manufactured by Mazda from 1970 to 2002. Sold in the Japanese domestic market under the Capella name, the vehicle was also commonly known in other major markets as the Mazda 626.

The Pioneer Helmet (also known as Wollaston Helmet or Northamptonshire Helmet) is a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon boar-crested helm found by archaeologists from Northamptonshire Archaeology at a quarry site operated by Pioneer Aggregates. This helmet is very similar in its basic design to the Coppergate Helmet, although it is much larger, and was likely to have had two cheek plates (of which only one remained) and a nasal (which was bent inwards at the time of deposition to render the piece unwearable). A simple iron boar crest adorns the top of this helmet associating it with the Benty Grange helmet and the Guilden Morden boar from the same period, and descriptions in the poem Beowulf. The helmet accompanied the burial of a young male, possibly laid on a bed with a pattern welded sword, small knife, hanging bowl, three iron buckles and a copper alloy clothes hook. The Sutton Hoo helmet is a decorated Anglo-Saxon helmet discovered during the 1939 excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship burial. It was buried around 625 and is widely believed to have been the helmet of King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia, and its elaborate decoration may have given it a secondary function akin to a crown. The helmet is \"the most iconic object\" from \"one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made,\" and one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever found.

For this reason, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Khang was not chosen as successor of Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng for the throne and he did not have a significant role in royal court either, as his younger brothers did.

He is best known for his 1998 novel \"The Hours\", which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1999. Cunningham is a senior lecturer of creative writing at Yale University. Specimen Days is a 2005 novel by American writer Michael Cunningham. It contains three stories: one that takes place in the past, one in the present, and one in the future. Each of the three stories depicts three central, semi-consistent character-types: a young boy, a man, and a woman. Walt Whitman's poetry is also a common thread in each of the three stories, and the title is from Whitman's own prose works. Sylvia Plath ( ; October 27, 1932\u00a0\u2013 February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. Plath was clinically depressed for most of her adult life, and was treated multiple times with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). She committed suicide in 1963. The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym \"Victoria Lucas\" in 1963, the novel is semi-autobiographical, with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a \"roman \u00e0 clef\" since the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother. The novel has been translated into nearly a dozen languages. The novel, though dark, is often read in high school English classes.\n\nClaim: \nThe author of The Bell Jar is German.

His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis. Peter Desaga was a German instrument maker at the University of Heidelberg who worked with Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. In 1855, Desaga perfected an earlier design of the laboratory burner by Michael Faraday into the Bunsen burner. The Desaga family held the right to market the burner for generations, as part of an agreement made with Bunsen. The Bunsen burner was essential to the invention of the spectroscope by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff. Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen ( ; ] ; 30 March 1811 \u2013 16 August 1899) was a German chemist. He investigated emission spectra of heated elements, and discovered caesium (in 1860) and rubidium (in 1861) with the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. Bunsen developed several gas-analytical methods, was a pioneer in photochemistry, and did early work in the field of organoarsenic chemistry. With his laboratory assistant, Peter Desaga, he developed the Bunsen burner, an improvement on the laboratory burners then in use. The Bunsen\u2013Kirchhoff Award for spectroscopy is named after Bunsen and Kirchhoff.

In 1833 he became first violinist of the orchestra at La Scala, a post he held through 1855. He also served as a conductor at La Scala, notably leading the world premieres of Gaetano Donizetti's \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (1833), Donizetti's \"Gemma di Vergy\" (1834), Donizetti's \"Maria Stuarda\" (1835), Saverio Mercadante's \"Il giuramento\" (1837), Mercadante's \"Il bravo\" (1839), Giuseppe Verdi's \"Oberto\" (1839), Verdi's \"Un giorno di regno\" (1840), Donizetti's \"Maria Padilla\" (1841), Verdi's \"Nabucco\" (1842), Verdi's \"I Lombardi alla prima crociata\" (1843), Verdi's \"Giovanna d'Arco\" (1845), Federico Ricci's \"Estella di Murcia\" (1846), and Domenico Ronzani's \"Salvator Rosa\" (1854).

When \u015eahin Giray fled for his life from his rebellious subjects, and sought succor from his protectress Catherine II in St. Petersburg, Benjamin Aga followed him, hoping to collect the large sums of money that he had advanced to the fugitive. Following the last partition of Poland in 1795, after Crimea had been under Russian rule for over a decade, Vilnius, Lutsk and Trakai came under Russian Rule. Benjamin Aga, Solomon ben Nahamu Bobowitz, and the astronomer Isaac of Kalea, the son-in-law of Jacob Aga, who was the elder brother of Benjamin, went to St. Petersburg as a delegation from the Crimean Karaites, to petition the empress to release their sect from the double rate of taxation which all the Jews then had to pay. Through the intervention of Count Nikolay Zubov, the delegation obtained from the empress the exemption from the \"Jewish\" taxes, some land grants, and other privileges which had not been asked for. This established an important precedent for exempting the Karaites from subsequent anti-Jewish legislation. The extraordinary success of the mission served to arouse great enthusiasm among the Karaites, and Aga and his fellow delegates were received with great honor on their return.

This may encompass keeping custody of documents lain before the house, received, or produced; making records of proceedings; allocating office space; enrolling of members, and administering an oath of office. The clerk in some cases has a ceremonial role. A clerk may also advise the speaker or members on parliamentary procedure, acting in American parlance as a \"parliamentarian\". The Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed. As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution. Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates. Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list. The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a \"definitive list\". However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada. In parliamentary procedure, especially the Westminster system, a document is laid before the house or Laid on the Table of the House when it is formally recognised as having been made available for members of a deliberative assembly to read. Documents produced by official bodies or in response to orders from parliament are required to be laid before the house. These documents inform members in their deliberations.

The story is set mostly in Pennsylvania, and the time of the narrative stretches from the early 1930s to 1950. Hason Raja, (Bengali: \u09b9\u09be\u09b8\u09a8 \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09be ; 18541922) was a Bengali poet, mystic philosopher and songwriter from Sylhet, Bangladesh, then a part of undivided India. He gained international recognition few years after his death, when Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, mentioned him in his lectures at Oxford University. Tagore said, \"We realise it through admiration and love, through hope that soars beyond the actual, beyond our own span of life into an endless time wherein we live of all men.\" and \"It is a village poet of East Bengal who preaches in a song the philosophical doctrine that the universe has its reality in its relation to the Person.\" John Henry O'Hara (January 31, 1905 \u2013 April 11, 1970) was an American writer, best remembered as a keen observer of social status and manners in early to mid 20th century America and pre-eminent among his contemporaries at depicting social realism. He first earned a reputation for short stories and later became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with \"Appointment in Samarra\" and \"BUtterfield 8\". Rabindranath Tagore FRAS ( ; ] ), also written Rav\u012bndran\u0101tha Th\u0101kura (7 May 1861\u00a0\u2013 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of \"Gitanjali\" and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\".\n\nClaim: \nElizabeth Appleton is a 1963 novel.

Ailbhe N\u00ed Bhriain remarks: 'The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - t\u00e1in, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior C\u00fachulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne. Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.' Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's T\u00e1in, they are a humble one. It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.' Mary Colum (n\u00e9e Maguire, June 14, 1884 \u2013 October 22, 1957) was an Irish literary critic and author, who also co-founded a literary journal. Scots is the Germanic language variety spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots). It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language which was historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 1500s. The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity. Ulster ( ; Irish: \"Ulaidh\" ] or \"C\u00faige Uladh\" ] , Ulster Scots: \"Ulst\u00e8r\" or \"Ulster\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. It is made up of nine counties, six of which are in Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom) and three of which are in the Republic of Ireland. It is the second largest and second most populous of Ireland's four provinces, with Belfast being its biggest city. Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of Protestants. Those of Catholic background make up about 51% of its population while those of Ulster Protestant background make up about 43%. English is the main language and Ulster English the main dialect. A minority also speak Irish, and there is a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking region) in the west of Ulster. Lough Neagh, in the east, is the largest lake in the British Isles, while Lough Erne in the west is one of its largest lake networks. The main mountain ranges are the Mournes, Sperrins, Croaghgorms and Derryveagh Mountains.\n\nClaim: \nQueen Medb of Connacht made her invasion in a province in the north of the island of a country.

The new Latin genus name is derived from the Latin \"cymba\" meaning boat. Its first known use was in 1815. Patrinia is a genus of herbaceous plants in the honeysuckle family. There are about 17 species native to grassy mountain habitats in China, Siberia and Japan. These are unassuming clump-forming perennial plants having thin, erect stems with few leaves and bearing a terminal inflorescence with yellow or white flowers. The use for this plant is to provide a flower through long hot summers.

Unlike most other orchids, sun orchids lack a highly modified labellum and all three petals are similar in size, shape and colour. The column is, however highly modified and usually has prominent wings or glands which are helpful in identifying the species. Most sun orchids close their flowers at night, in cloudy or cool weather, giving rise to their common name. The scientific name means \"woman's hood\" and refers to the hooded column present in most, but not all species.

Some of the finest buildings in New Jersey, New York City, and other large eastern cities were built by the Hedden Construction Company, one of the largest construction companies operating in Newark in the very early 1900s. Among the most notable is the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower located at One Madison Avenue in New York, NY. The tower was the world's tallest building from 1909 to 1913 and home to the Hedden Construction Company's main offices located on the 36th and 37th floors. During this prosperous period over $40,000,000 in construction contracts and payments were collected by the firm. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, colloquially known as the Met Life Tower, is a landmark skyscraper located on Madison Avenue near the intersection with East 23rd Street, across from Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City. Designed by the architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons and built by the Hedden Construction Company, the tower is modeled after the Campanile in Venice, Italy. The hotel located in the clock tower portion of the building has the address 5 Madison Avenue, while the office building covering the rest of the block, occupied primarily by Credit Suisse, is referred to as 1 Madison Avenue. The Princess Tower (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0629\u200e \u200e ) is a 101 story, 413.4 m tall residential-only skyscraper located in the Marina district of Dubai, UAE. Princess Tower is currently the second tallest building in Dubai, after the Burj Khalifa, and the 24th tallest building in the world. Princess Tower was the tallest residential building in the world from 2012 to 2015, when it was overtaken by 432 Park Avenue in New York City.\n\nClaim: \nThe most notable building that was built by Hedden Construction Company has two addresses.

The goal was to treat Germany as a single economic zone, but trade issues necessitated that the Western and Eastern zones of the country be considered separately.\n\n\nBy 1949, the Western half of Germany, also known as the Federal Republic of Germany, had taken on the model of a Western democracy, while the Soviet-controlled Eastern side was a socialist state. Prime Minister Hans Modrow headed a caretaker government which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.\n\n\nIn early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the Volkskammer held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. The conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990.[62] These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession).\n\nClaim: \nAfter World War II, Germany underwent a major overhaul of its political system in an effort to prevent another dictatorship from taking power.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth\u2019s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun\u2019s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells \u2013skin, blood, bone \u2013 which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job.

A positive number indicates farsightedness. A diopter designates how powerful a lens is needed to properly focus light on a person\u2019s retina. Many people have astigmatism in addition to myopia or hyperopia. In astigmatism, the cornea has a curvature imperfection, or the lens is distorted, resulting in both near and far objects appearing blurry. Reading lenses are rated in diopters, a formula opticians use. Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it\u2019s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or \u201cdiopter\u201d, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6] In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n\u201cNeed to zoom into a photo?

Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives \u2014 one exposed for the land, the other for the sky \u2014 and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins \u2014 one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds.\n\nClaim: \nTraditional photographic prints could be altered using methods such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art); negatives could be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The condition is more likely to affect people age 30 to 60 and men are more likely to get salivary stones than women. The cause is not known, but several factors are associated with salivary stone formation:\n\n\n* Dehydration, due to inadequate fluid intake, illness, or medications such as diuretics (water pills) and anticholinergic drugs\n\n\n* Trauma to the inside of the mouth\n\n\n* Smoking\n\n\n* Gum disease A salivary gland stone -- also called salivary duct stone -- is a calcified structure that may form inside a salivary gland or duct. It can block the flow of saliva into the mouth.\n\n\nThe majority of stones affect the submandibular glands located at the floor of the mouth. Less commonly, the stones affect the parotid glands, located on the inside of the cheeks, or the sublingual glands, which are under the tongue. Many people with the condition have multiple stones. Salivary stones form when chemicals in the saliva accumulate in the duct or gland. They mostly contain calcium. The exact cause is not known. But factors contributing to less saliva production and/or thickened saliva may be risk factors for salivary stones. These factors include: dehydration, poor eating, and use of certain medications including some antihistamines, blood pressure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and bladder control drugs. Trauma to the salivary glands may also raise the risk for salivary stones. Salivary stones are rarely serious, and a person can often treat them at home.\n\n\nHome remedies for getting rid of salivary stones include:\n\n\n* Sucking on citrus fruits or hard candies. Sucking on a wedge of lemon or orange increases the flow of saliva, which can help dislodge the stone. A person can also try sucking on sugar-free gum or hard, sour candies, such as lemon drops.\n* Drinking plenty of fluids. Regular fluid intake helps keep the mouth hydrated and can increase saliva flow.\n* Gentle massage.

When you pee, the sulfur byproducts evaporate almost immediately, causing you to smell that unpleasant scent. The asparagusic acid in asparagus produces many sulfurous byproducts that give your pee a rotten-like smell.\n\n\nThe smell can be detected as early as 15 minutes after eating asparagus and may last up to 14 hours.

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. \u201cHe said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function \u2014 they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,\u201d Rosenthal says. The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish\u2019s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn\u2019t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. \u201cIf we can, you can bet they can,\u201d he says.\n\n\nBy having \u201ciconically different\u201d color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression \u2014 in other words, if you\u2019re different from everyone you\u2019re not competing with, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy. One of the ways they\u2019ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals \u2014 mating, camouflage and territory \u2014 in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cIn the Pacific, you don\u2019t have that luxury anymore, because there\u2019s not as much light, and there\u2019s not as much fidelity of spatial information.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nThis theory was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace in the 19th century.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Germany as we know it today didn\u2019t actually form until the 19th century, when Otto von Bismarck united politically independent regions with different customs, names and dialects into an empire in 1871.\n\n\nThis means that most terms for \u2018Germany\u2019 stem from a time when Germany didn\u2019t really exist. Instead, there was the \u2018Alemanni\u2019 tribe in the German-speaking part of the Alsace and the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg region bordering France, where they say \u2018Allemagne\u2019. Meanwhile, in Estonia and Finland, where Germany today is known as Saksamaa and Saksa respectively, people generally thought of Saxons when dealing with Germans. When the Roman Empire was taking over Europe, Germania was the Latin term used to describe the area inhabited by Germanic tribes. However, \u2018German\u2019 and \u2018Germany\u2019 only began to be used in English around the 1500s; before that, \u2018Almain\u2019, \u2018Alman\u2019 and \u2018Dutch\u2019 were used \u2013 which brings us to the next category.

These molds are safe for healthy adults to eat. However, these cheeses, as well as other soft cheeses and cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, are best avoided by people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, infants and young children. when visible mold is present, its tentacles\u2014called \u201cthreads\u201d\u2014have likely penetrated deep into your food, contaminating even those parts that appear to be mold-free.\n\n\nThe health risks of mold exposure are many. \u201cMold can produce toxic substances, called mycotoxins,\u201d says Katie George, a clinical dietitian at the University of Kansas Hospital.

Chasing an endless summer as trans-equatorial migrants, these masters of migration cross into northern oceans in search of food and warmer weather. Perhaps no other species are as famous for this as the Pacific Ocean populations of Sooty and Short-tailed Shearwaters. These salty seabirds breed around Australia and New Zealand generally arriving at their breeding colonies in October, laying eggs in November, and fledging chicks by late April. Departing the oceans of these areas in the southern fall, they arrive in Japan, Alaska, and California by May and June. Migration in North America is essentially north-south along four principal routes or \"flyways\"; Pacific, Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic. In Europe and Asia, some migration routes are oriented more east-west, although latitudinal change is still significant. About 150 species of land and freshwater birds that breed in our region winter to the south in Central and South America and the West Indies.

Your temperature starts to rise toward morning, preparing your body for wakefulness. Keep it cool. The ideal temperature for sleep is around 65\u00b0, so set your thermostat accordingly. If that seems too chilly for comfort, experiment to find the temperature that\u2019s right for you. During this part of the sleep cycle, you lose some of your ability to thermoregulate, i.e., adjust your inner temperature to the surrounding air temperature.\n\n\nSo when the room temperature is too warm, your body starts to heat up which can wake you and make it hard to get back to sleep. A stressful day and an overactive brain aren\u2019t the only things keeping you awake at night.

In the case of an active shooter, it can be argued that a tactically sound choice for the officer would be to go to the trunk of the squad car to get kitted up (hard plates, rifle, helmet) before rushing in with nothing more than a pistol and soft armor.

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth\u2019s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun\u2019s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells \u2013skin, blood, bone \u2013 which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger.

It is not unusual for healthy people involved in endurance activities to develop a bradycardia based on the increased vagal tone from training that suppresses heart rate.

If you exercise frequently and are reasonably fit, your heart rate may be lower than other people.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. A low heart rate means your heart needs fewer beats to deliver the same amount of blood throughout your body. Increased cardiovascular fitness causes real physical changes in the structure of the heart. The muscles in the heart wall thicken, and the heart pumps more blood with each beat.

The amount of interest the banks collect on the loans is greater than the amount of interest they pay to customers with savings accounts\u2014and the difference is the banks\u2019 profit.\n\n\nFor example: You currently have an emergency fund of $10,000 in a high yield savings account that may pay 1.50% APY.

Now, think about this process repeated with millions of banking customers and billions of dollars. Yes, banks make a lot of money banks from charging borrowers interest, but the fees banks change are just as lucrative.\n\n\n* Account fees. Some typical financial products that charge fees are checking accounts, investment accounts, and credit cards. These fees are said to be for \u201cmaintenances purposes\u201d even though maintaining these accounts costs banks relatively little.\n* ATM fees.

Such situations happen all the time and just mean more money for banks. * Penalty charges. Banks love to slap on a penalty fee for something a customer\u2019s mishaps. It could a credit card payment that you sent in at 5:05PM. It could be a check written for an amount that was one penny over what you had in your checking account.

Most banks will have investment divisions that often function as full-service brokerages. Of course, their commission fees for making trades are higher than most discount brokers.\n* Application fees.

Initially, his subjects were photographed with a white background however gradually he began using different backdrops. Apart from photographing his subjects, he poses with them in many pictures as well. In some pictures he lends his glasses to his subjects so they could pose pretending to be him and he could pose like them. American fashion photographer Terry Richardson is one of the most prolific and acclaimed photographers of today. His trademark snapshot aesthetic and excessively sexual style has brought an appealing edge to mainstream advertising.\n\nTerry Richardson came from a highly artistic family background. Quintessential Terry Richardson photos are without a doubt some of the most recognizable photos in the world. Famous for his non-nonchalant hipster vibe, Terry Richardson has a serious taste for the unconventional.\n\nWhether it's an ad campaign, an editorial in GQ or simply celebrity photography fun, a Terry Richardson photo is unlike any other style of photography out there. Highly saturated colors, Polaroid-style, white background, goofy faces and sultry poses are a part in most, if not all, of Terry's photography. From Obama, Lindsay Lohan, Kate Upton to Rhianna, Terry has a way of making the subject of his images let loose and feel as if they're having a great time playing around with a friend.\n\nAlmost as famous for his signature square glasses as he is for his photography, Terry Richardson photos capture some of this generation's most famous celebrities.\n\nClaim: \nHe is known for taking pictures of some of the most famous celebrities of this generation, ranging from Obama, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Upton to Rhianna.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6] In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n\u201cNeed to zoom into a photo? Be sure to bust out the magnifying glass and a bottle of patience along with that steady hand of yours. No sorry, there\u2019s no history states or layers. You can also forget about that wonderful healing brush! Here\u2019s a paint brush instead\u201d\n\n\nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse. Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio \u2014 as was a steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow. You can even see some of the hard work that went into perfecting photos in this annotation of a famous Dennis Stock image, which has been marked up by Pablo Inirio. MIA FINEMAN: Most of the earliest manipulated photographs were attempts to compensate for the new medium\u2019s technical limitations \u2014 specifically, its inability to depict the world as it appears to the naked eye.\n\n\nWhen photography was first introduced in 1839, people wondered how a medium that could render forms and textures with such exquisite detail could fail to register the ever-present element of color. Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives \u2014 one exposed for the land, the other for the sky \u2014 and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins \u2014 one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds.\n\nClaim: \nIn the 19th century, photographers also resorted to manual interventions to compensate for the early medium\u2019s technical limitations, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and particles (literally stardust--the remains of a star that had exploded) billions of years ago. The \"dust\" clumped together to form the planets. Some of the leftover dust formed the moons of the planets (although the origin of Earth's moon is still up for debate). Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings. It is likely that large rings couldn't form on inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) because the rings are made of frozen icy dust, and the sun is too hot this close to it for the rings to form. \u201cThere are various theories about planetary rings, like the fantastic rings around Saturn, but we cannot say for sure how they are formed,\u201d explains Lattis.\n\n\nOne theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet\u2019s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.\n\n\nAnother idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet\u2019s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system. The larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to form like solar systems in miniature. We think each of them pulled in lots of material and had a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding it during formation. Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites. These irregular moons are relatively small and have orbits with large inclinations, eccentricities, and semimajor axes.\n\n\nIn contrast, the terrestrial planets formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them. They grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust. Earth\u2019s Moon probably formed through a direct collision.

Here, we are using the bearing to objects to determine position of points along the coastline. Still, it works much the same way.\n\n\nMaps - especially of shorelines - were almost certainly made from observations taken from boats. Naval navigation is much more accurate than navigation on land (especially without good maps!). Prior to the mid-1700's, the primary means of navigation was dead reckoning (DR). This requires that you iteratively advance your position on the map from your last known position using direction and time/distance. Of course, over time, errors will compound resulting in reduced accuracy. You must have a way of measuring your direction of travel and a (somewhat) accurate value for your speed.\n\n\nLater in the 1700's, it was possible to navigate more accurately using celestial navigation. This allowed a skilled navigator to determine his position rather accurately (typically within a few miles) at any point on the globe. The position was typically found once each day and advanced using DR as necessary. The topics of navigation and cartography are two sides of the same coin, and there are entire books written about each. It is interesting to study the history of cartography because it very graphically shows the corresponding improvements in navigation over time.\n\n\nIn order to make an accurate map, you need to know first where you are making your observations from. Making the observations from a previously known position will result in much greater accuracy. This position may have been established by an earlier survey (eg, working from a known point on an existing map) or by being able to independently figure out your position with good certainty on the position of the globe. The problem was the portolan mapmakers\u2019 lack of a systematic way of reducing the spherical Earth to a flat map. That was of little consequence for short journeys but mattered much more when sailing longer distances. In 1569, the Belgian geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator created his method for presenting a spherical world on a flat map, the one familiar to us today. This mapmaking technique, though it stretched and compressed landmarks and distances between them, had the great advantage that a straight compass course was represented by a straight line on the map.\n\n\nMercator\u2019s projections began to be used to sail the open seas by the early 1800s, by which time portolan charts had pretty much disappeared. But their importance is undeniable. \u201cThe development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,\u201d Hessler says. \u201cUnderstanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nThis method was not very accurate, and was often inaccurate over long distances.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. \u201cHe said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function \u2014 they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,\u201d Rosenthal says. The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish\u2019s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn\u2019t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. \u201cIf we can, you can bet they can,\u201d he says.\n\n\nBy having \u201ciconically different\u201d color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression \u2014 in other words, if you\u2019re different from everyone you\u2019re not competing with, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy. One of the ways they\u2019ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals \u2014 mating, camouflage and territory \u2014 in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cIn the Pacific, you don\u2019t have that luxury anymore, because there\u2019s not as much light, and there\u2019s not as much fidelity of spatial information.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nOverall, the bright colors of fish that live around coral reefs allow them to blend in with their environment, recognize their own species, and communicate with each other in the surrounding water.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions. Of the 15 industries employing the greatest percentage of foreign-born workers, half are low-wage service industries, including gardening, domestic household work, car washes, shoe repair and janitorial work. A recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\" First, many immigrants send portions of their income out of the domestic economy in the form of remittances, but it is hard to know if this is materially different from domestic purchase of imports, and besides, ultimately those cash flows circulate back to demand for U.S. goods in the form of exports. Second, migrants are paid their marginal product (as is any worker), meaning that much if not most of their value added to production directly benefits the native population.\n\nClaim: \nThis is not a factor in Mexico, where most immigrants do not have access to the same remittance channels.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The stock market works through a network of exchanges \u2014 you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock. The stock market is a constellation of exchanges where securities like stocks and bonds are bought and sold. In the United States, \u201cthe stock market\u201d and \u201cWall Street\u201d can refer to the entire world of securities trading\u2014including stock exchanges where the shares of public companies are listed for sale and markets where other securities are traded.\n\n\nThe stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.\n\nClaim: \nWhen you do, the money you get from selling the stock goes back into your pocket.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\n\n\nBeyond that, a person\u2019s brain may actually block out a dream so we don\u2019t remember it the following day. \u201cThe dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn\u2019t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives. Thus it is normal to forget dreams, most of the time.\u201d Dimitriu says. A study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology and reported by International Business Times suggested that those people who reported high dream recall had more activity in the temporoparietal junction than those who didn\u2019t recall their dreams often.\n\n\nLambert tells Healthline that if someone consistently doesn\u2019t get enough sleep, the amount of REM sleep they experience will drop, making it harder for them to remember their dreams the following day.\n\n\nEven personality traits can be an indicator of whether someone will be able to remember their dreams.\n\n\nLambert continues: \u201cResearchers also looked at the most common personality traits that are presented in people who can recall their dreams. Overall, such people are prone to daydreaming, creative thinking, and introspection. At the same time, those who are more practical and focused on what is outside themselves tend to have difficulty remembering their dreams.\u201d\n\n\nThis may mean that some people are naturally more likely to recall their dreams than others, despite their quality of sleep.\n\n\nOther factors, like stress or experiencing a trauma, can also cause people to have vivid dreams or nightmares that they\u2019re more likely to recall the next day. For example, a person who\u2019s coping with grief after losing a loved one may dream about the death in elaborate detail. Remembering the dream the next day may affect mood and cause even more stress or anxiety. People who have the ability to recall their dreams five mornings per week, on average, have more spontaneous activity occurring in certain parts of their brains than others. The parts of the brain that host these increased levels of activity are called the temporo-parietal junction, which is an information-processing hub, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the expression of personality as well as the planning of complex cognitive behaviors. And, interestingly, this escalation in liveliness is higher during both wakefulness and sleep, so says a study of 41 people recently published online February 19 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. The activity in the brains of the people in this study were measured by Positron Emission Tomography while they were awake and sleeping. What do these findings tell us?\n\n\nIn combination with previous research from one of the study\u2019s authors, Perrine Ruby, the findings tell us why some people remember their dreams and some do not. Ruby co-authored related research that was published last year in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which showed that people who have the ability to regularly recall their dreams are also more reactive to sounds when they are both asleep and awake. Ruby made some comments in a recent statement that synthesized the findings for both of these studies. Ruby stated that the brain needs to awaken from sleep in order to memorize new information. This, said Ruby, may explain the reason that those who react more to environmental stimuli can remember their dreams better; they simply are awakened more often and can therefore better encode into memory their dreams than others who are less reactive to sounds. In addition, the researchers said that people who often recall their dreams may also have more dreams than \u201clow-recall\u201d dreamers.\n\nClaim: \nLastly, recent research suggests that people who have the ability to recall their dreams may have more activity in certain areas of their brain, such as the temporoparietal junction and the prefrontal cortex, which can help them to better encode the information from their dreams into their memory.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Over time, this media becomes filled with dirt and debris, preventing the engine from breathing properly. As a result, the engine will work harder and use more fuel. One of the biggest reasons to change your air filter regularly. Some studies indicate that replacing a dirty air filter increases fuel mileage on older, carburated cars by as much as 14 percent if the filter is so dirty it affects driveability. In addition, changing a clogged air filter can potentially increase acceleration by 6 to 11 percent on modern fuel-injected cars. Other studies claim a 10 percent increase in gas mileage and up to 15\u00a2 per gallon fuel savings. Regardless of the exact figures, it is obvious that a clean air filter improves air flow to the engine and increases engine performance and gas mileage. When your air filter is dirty, your engine is forced to work harder, resulting in poor fuel economy, higher emissions and, possibly, a loss of engine power. In turn, as a worst-case scenario, a clogged cabin air filter can lead to under-performance of the A/C system, causing weak air flow from the cabin vents. It can also lead to unwanted, unfiltered air in the cabin. As for a mucked-up fuel filter, that\u2019ll land you with a weakened fuel supply to injectors, a reduction in engine power, poor acceleration and lousy fuel economy\u2014not to mention a potential breakdown.\n\nClaim: \nSimilarly, a mucked-up fuel filter can lead to a weakened fuel supply to injectors, a reduction in engine power, poor acceleration, and lousy fuel economy.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions. Of the 15 industries employing the greatest percentage of foreign-born workers, half are low-wage service industries, including gardening, domestic household work, car washes, shoe repair and janitorial work. A recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\" First, many immigrants send portions of their income out of the domestic economy in the form of remittances, but it is hard to know if this is materially different from domestic purchase of imports, and besides, ultimately those cash flows circulate back to demand for U.S. goods in the form of exports. Second, migrants are paid their marginal product (as is any worker), meaning that much if not most of their value added to production directly benefits the native population.\n\nClaim: \nThis is unlike in Mexico, where undocumented immigrants returning to the country often face lower wages than their U.S. counterparts.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

Many people have astigmatism in addition to myopia or hyperopia. In astigmatism, the cornea has a curvature imperfection, or the lens is distorted, resulting in both near and far objects appearing blurry. Reading lenses are rated in diopters, a formula opticians use. Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it\u2019s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or \u201cdiopter\u201d, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range. In contrast, if you are working at your desk and your computer monitor is 24 inches away, you will need a weaker power than you would for reading.\n\nClaim: \nFor example, someone with nearsightedness may need a negative diopter, while someone with farsightedness may need a positive diopter.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6] In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n\u201cNeed to zoom into a photo?

You can even see some of the hard work that went into perfecting photos in this annotation of a famous Dennis Stock image, which has been marked up by Pablo Inirio. MIA FINEMAN: Most of the earliest manipulated photographs were attempts to compensate for the new medium\u2019s technical limitations \u2014 specifically, its inability to depict the world as it appears to the naked eye.\n\n\nWhen photography was first introduced in 1839, people wondered how a medium that could render forms and textures with such exquisite detail could fail to register the ever-present element of color. Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives \u2014 one exposed for the land, the other for the sky \u2014 and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins \u2014 one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds.\n\nClaim: \nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers would labor long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Due to this, whenever particles collide, they may move in any direction, but all the up and down motion cancels out, always following the rule that the total spin in that plane must be constant. This is due to a rule known as the conservation of angular momentum \u2013 the total amount of spinning in any isolated system, such as the Solar System, will always remain constant. This allowed the cloud to flatten over time, losing its height and becoming the roughly two-dimensional disc we see today. As the particles bump into each other, all the up and down motion tends to cancel out, it's energy lost in crashing and clumping. Yet, the whole mass must continue spinning, inexorably, because in our universe, the total amount of spinning in any isolated system always stays the same.

The goal was to treat Germany as a single economic zone, but trade issues necessitated that the Western and Eastern zones of the country be considered separately.\n\n\nBy 1949, the Western half of Germany, also known as the Federal Republic of Germany, had taken on the model of a Western democracy, while the Soviet-controlled Eastern side was a socialist state. Prime Minister Hans Modrow headed a caretaker government which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.\n\n\nIn early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the Volkskammer held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. The conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990.[62] These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession).\n\nClaim: \nThese changes were designed to ensure that a dictator figure could never take power again.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The phrase \u201cagnosticism\u201d was first used by Thomas Henry Huxley against religious people who accused him of denouncing the role of God in the creation of the universe. Huxley supported the theories of evolution by Charles Darwin and did not subscribe to religious beliefs. He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence. Huxley thought that agnosticism was a principle and not a belief. He reiterated that it is wrong for one to claim a phenomenon is a definite truth unless logical evidence is provided. The word was coined as the antagonist of the phrase \u201cGnosticism,\u201d meaning \u201cknowledge.\u201d Gnosticism was a religious ideology in the first and second centuries that suggested that the material world was ungodly while the spirit world was the better choice. Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God. He challenged the religious and atheists to prove or disprove the presence of God. \u201cMaybe there is a God, but maybe not. I\u2019m just not sure.

First, we know that adolescent and young adult brains are \u201cprimed\u201d for risk-taking and exploratory behavior \u2014 some more than others. But in general, college students are likely to focus on immediate rewards and an experience that might make a \u201cgood story\u201d later rather than think about the possible consequences of their behavior. Unfortunately, the consequences of this sort of behavior can change a life trajectory very quickly.\n\nA second driving force behind excessive drinking behavior is the perception that it is normative and accepted \u2014 the idea that \u201ceveryone is doing it\u201d \u2014 when in fact it\u2019s a minority of students. Many schools try to send messages about the relative rarity of very heavy consumption of alcohol to correct these misperceptions by students.\n\nThird, there are many individual-level factors that heighten one\u2019s risk for binge drinking, like being impulsive, or having a tendency to break rules. Lastly, the availability of alcohol is key. For example, where there is widespread access and low prices, there will be a greater likelihood that students will engage in heavy drinking as compared with places where access is more lim\n\nClaim: \nThere are also individual-level factors that can contribute to binge drinking, such as impulsivity or a tendency to break rules.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

They immediately went into the studio and laid down that song and \"Guilty Conscience\" by the end of the day. The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath's parent label Interscope, suggested that Dr. Dre sign Eminem, a white rapper from Detroit. Dre produced three songs and provided vocals for two on Eminem's successful and controversial debut album The Slim Shady LP, released in 1999.[28] The Dr. Dre-produced lead single from that album, \"My Name Is\", brought Eminem to public attention for the first time, and the success of The Slim Shady LP \u2013 it reached number two on the Billboard 200 and received general acclaim from critics \u2013 revived the label's commercial ambitions and viability.[28][29][30]\n\nClaim: \nIt is clear that without Dr. Dre, Eminem's career would not have had the same level of success.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

A small amount of the increased clarity of vision is due to changing the shape of the eye as you squint. However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the \u201cpinhole effect\u201d. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as \u201cdepth of field\u201d. The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus. By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image. So, that means that squinting works by two mechanisms \u2013 by both changing the shape of the eye and by letting in light that can be focused more precisely by the lens.\n\nClaim: \nThis is similar to the way a larger aperture works in a camera, where a smaller hole lets less light in, with better focus.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth\u2019s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun\u2019s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells \u2013skin, blood, bone \u2013 which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job. Some cells were tasked with making junctions to hold the group together, while other cells made digestive enzymes that could break down food.\n\n## The First Animals\n\nThese clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago\n\nClaim: \nThe process of evolution is often driven by natural selection and random genetic mutation.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

When the planets in our solar system began to form, space was filled with billions and billions of pieces of dust and gas.\n\n\nAs these pieces bumped into each other, they began to form clumps that slowly grew larger and larger. Eventually these clumps of material grew large enough to develop their own gravitational fields.\n\n\nAs the forming planets continued to grow, the force of the collisions with additional matter caused them to become hot and molten, acting much like a liquid. Each planet's gravitational force is centered at its core. It pulls equally in every direction from the core, thus pulling all the molten material into a spherical shape. Scientists call this process \"isostatic adjustment.\" \"But gravity is not the whole story,\" says Carpenter. While gravity conspires to render the planets spherical, the speed of their rotations is simultaneously trying to flatten them. The faster a celestial body spins, the more disproportionate its equatorial bulge gets. \"This is why there are no perfect spheres in our solar system ... only oblate spheroids,\" Carpenter tells us. \"The sun is almost a perfect sphere, due to its immense gravity and relatively slow rotation rate of 25 days. A significant percentage of stars in the sky rotate much faster and bulge noticeably at their equators.\" * Planets aren't perfect spheres - because they are spinning they get pulled out slightly around their equator making them a bit \"fatter\" so they are in fact oval. Derek Sears, professor of cosmochemistry at the University of Arkansas, explains.\n\n\nPlanets are round because their gravitational field acts as though it originates from the center of the body and pulls everything toward it. With its large body and internal heating from radioactive elements, a planet behaves like a fluid, and over long periods of time succumbs to the gravitational pull from its center of gravity. The only way to get all the mass as close to planet's center of gravity as possible is to form a sphere. The technical name for this process is \"isostatic adjustment.\"\n\n\nWith much smaller bodies, such as the 20-kilometer asteroids we have seen in recent spacecraft images, the gravitational pull is too weak to overcome the asteroid's mechanical strength. As a result, these bodies do not form spheres. Rather they maintain irregular, fragmentary shapes.\n\nClaim: \nIn addition, a square or rectangular planet is impossible because there would need to be an external force acting on it to keep it in that shape, which is not possible due to the lack of gravity in space.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

However, it\u2019s so easy for sleepiness to be ruined by a sudden high-pitched police alarm or the cheers of drunken revelers. The reason this is such an issue is that, unlike a constant noise, or brains just can\u2019t get used to sudden volume spikes. Every sudden noise could be a danger, which leaves us permanently on alert and unable to relax. After all, sleep is when we\u2019re most defenseless, so our brain really doesn\u2019t want to \u2018switch off\u2019 when there\u2019s what seems like potential danger. White noise can help this. Let\u2019s say that the car horn is a 70 decibel sound. If you\u2019re lying in almost complete silence, maybe with a little wind outside, that\u2019s around 20 decibels. That sudden 50 decibel jump is HUGE, and will totally spring you awake. Instead, if you have a white noise generator or are playing white noise from your speakers/laptop, this could be a nice, continuous sound at around 50 decibels (just about the level of normal conversation). Suddenly, that same 70 decibel car noise is only a 20 decibel jump. It\u2019s much less noticeable, and so much less likely to shock you into being jolted awake. Reactions to sounds during sleep can be influenced by meaning and significance. Sounds indicating possible danger\u2014even very quiet sounds, like the opening of a door\u2014often will easily wake a sleeping person. Hearing their children cry usually causes parents to wake almost instantly. These responses to noise are highly individual, and a sign of how deeply engaged the brain remains to external stimuli during sleep.\n\nClaim: \nTo combat this, people can use white noise generators to create a continuous sound at a consistent volume that is just above the level of normal conversation.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

We probably don\u2019t think twice about buying something for $5.99 or $16.99, but it is a little strange when you think about it. Why aren\u2019t prices just even dollar amounts? Is it an elaborate marketing scheme to get you to spend more?\n\nWell, essentially\u2026yes. But there\u2019s really nothing \u201celaborate\u201d about it; it\u2019s actually pretty simple. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of psychological pricing,\u201d says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. \u201cBecause we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.\u201d This is especially effective if you\u2019re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9\u2013$9.99 \u201crange\u201d rather than the $10\u2013$10.99 \u201crange.\u201d \u201cConsumers don\u2019t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,\u201d explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management. Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained. That's why shoppers are more likely to buy a product for $4.99 than an identical one for $5 the item that starts with a 4 just seems like a better deal than the one that starts with 5.\n\n\"We also tend to attempt to reduce the amount of effort expended on making product decisions, especially with lower-cost items,\" Hibbett told Life's Little Mysteries. \"So we may not really process the numbers after the dollar amount.\"\n\nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, according to the article \"Mind Your Pricing Cues,\" published in the September 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review. Price-conscious consumers have become conditioned to believe that they are getting a good deal when they buy something with a price ending in .99 even if the markdown is minimal.\n\nClaim: \nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, as price-conscious consumers have become conditioned to believe that they are getting a good deal when they buy something with a price ending in .99 even if the markdown is minimal.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The phrase \u201cagnosticism\u201d was first used by Thomas Henry Huxley against religious people who accused him of denouncing the role of God in the creation of the universe. Huxley supported the theories of evolution by Charles Darwin and did not subscribe to religious beliefs. He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence. Huxley thought that agnosticism was a principle and not a belief. He reiterated that it is wrong for one to claim a phenomenon is a definite truth unless logical evidence is provided. The word was coined as the antagonist of the phrase \u201cGnosticism,\u201d meaning \u201cknowledge.\u201d Gnosticism was a religious ideology in the first and second centuries that suggested that the material world was ungodly while the spirit world was the better choice. Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God. He challenged the religious and atheists to prove or disprove the presence of God. \u201cMaybe there is a God, but maybe not. I\u2019m just not sure.

And given a lack of knowledge concerning the question of God\u2019s existence \u2013 or the lack of any possibility of such knowledge -- an agnostic simply sighs and shrugs, offering an unapologetic \u201cWho knows?\u201d to the whole matter.\n\n\nIn the words of philosopher Julian Baggini, an agnostic \u201cclaims we cannot know whether God exists and so the only rational option is to reserve judgment.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nThis idea of unknowability has grown over the years, and in North America has become a sort of default opinion for those who do not want to commit to either a belief in or disbelief of God.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

These alcohols are toxic, and may cause symptoms if swallowed in amounts greater than 30 milliliters. Taste and smell are separate senses with their own receptor organs, yet they are intimately entwined. Tastants, chemicals in foods, are detected by taste buds, which consist of special sensory cells. When stimulated, these cells send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants, airborne odor molecules. Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hairlike cilia at the tips of the sensory cells, a process that initiates a neural response. Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors of food. Airborne odor molecules, called odorants, are detected by specialized sensory neurons located in a small patch of mucus membrane lining the roof of the nose. Axons of these sensory cells pass through perforations in the overlying bone and enter two elongated olfactory bulbs lying against the underside of the frontal lobe of the brain. The senses of smell and taste combine at the back of the throat. When you taste something before you smell it, the smell lingers internally up to the nose causing you to smell it. Both smell and taste use chemoreceptors, which essentially means they are both sensing the chemical environment. This chemoreception in regards to taste, occurs via the presence of specialized taste receptors within the mouth that are referred to as taste cells and are bundled together to form taste buds. These taste buds, located in papillae which are found across the tongue, are specific for the five modalities: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami.

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth\u2019s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun\u2019s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells \u2013skin, blood, bone \u2013 which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job. Some cells were tasked with making junctions to hold the group together, while other cells made digestive enzymes that could break down food.\n\n## The First Animals\n\nThese clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago\n\nClaim: \nRandom genetic mutation is the process by which new genetic information is created and passed on from one generation to the next, allowing organisms to adapt to new environments.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

Help your child develop this skill with lots of gross motor hand-eye exercises. For example, play bean bag games, ball tossing games, and bat and ball games as much as possible.

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. \u201cHe said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function \u2014 they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,\u201d Rosenthal says. The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish\u2019s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn\u2019t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. \u201cIf we can, you can bet they can,\u201d he says.\n\n\nBy having \u201ciconically different\u201d color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression \u2014 in other words, if you\u2019re different from everyone you\u2019re not competing with, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy. One of the ways they\u2019ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals \u2014 mating, camouflage and territory \u2014 in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cIn the Pacific, you don\u2019t have that luxury anymore, because there\u2019s not as much light, and there\u2019s not as much fidelity of spatial information.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nAdditionally, by having distinct color patterns, fish can minimize the costs of aggression, since they don't have to compete with other species.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well. The film is not harmful, but is distasteful to many and can be prevented with constant stirring and a close eye on temperature. It is often surprising to see a film or skin on nonfat or \u201cskim\u201d milk, since it would seem that, without fat, the proteins would have nothing to bind to. In truth, it is rare to encounter milk that is truly fat free. Most of the skim milk that is sold commercially has very low fat content, but is rarely ever truly fat-free. Even trace amounts of fat on the surface can contribute to skin formation.\n\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with soy milk, which is generally marketed as fat free. Natural fats still occur in trace amounts, and can be drawn to the surface when exposed to very high temperatures. Soy film can be discarded, but is also considered a delicacy in many Asian cultures. When removed and dried, it is referred to as yuba, or soybean curd, which is used in a variety of recipes. Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk (such as hot chocolate and some soups). Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation. The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed, as protein's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process. Milk film is often considered to be desirable and is used in several recipes for various foods.\n\nClaim: \nThis forms a skin on the milk.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

As the altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure pushing down on water decreases, which allows the water to boil at lower temperatures.\n\n\nA lower boiling point means that food cooks at a lower temperature, despite the fact that the water is boiling. It is important to recognize just how much the temperature of boiling water is reduced as the altitude increases. Water molecules have an easy time escaping off the surface when the air pressure above them is less. Since this is a naturally-occurring condition in high altitude regions, the boiling point of water is reduced and thus it attains the boiling It also impacts the boiling point of water: the temperature at which liquid water begins turning to vapor, which occurs when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. At a higher elevation, the lower atmospheric pressure means heated water reaches its boiling point more quickly\u2014i.e., at a lower temperature. Water at sea level boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit; at 5,000 feet above sea level, the boiling point is 203 degrees F.

It is the reverse of evaporation, where liquid water becomes a vapor.\n\n\nCondensation happens one of two ways: Either the air is cooled to its dew point or it becomes so saturate d with water vapor that it cannot hold any more water.\n\n\nDew Point\n\n\nDew point is the temperature at which condensation happens. (Dew is simply condensed water in the atmosphere.) Air temperatures can reach or fall below the dew point naturally, as they often do at night. Thats why lawns, cars, and houses are often coated with water droplets in the morning.\n\n\nCondensation can also produce water droplets on the outside of soda cans or glasses of cold water. When warm air hits the cold surface, it reaches its dew point and condenses. This leaves droplets of water on the glass or can. The drops of water on the outside of a cold cup come from the air.Believe it or not, there is a significant amount of water vapor in the air that we breathe. This is why we have humidity. A cold cup can take thermal energy out of the water vapor in the air next to the cup, causing the water vapor to condense into liquid water. The same kind of phenomena occurs when you take ice cream out of the freezer - you see frost on the outside of the container. In this case the cup (or ice cream container) is below the freezing point of water. Therefore, the water vapor from the air will freeze when it comes in contact with the container, forming a layer of frost. Ever wonder where those little drops of water on the outside of your cold can of soda pop or bottle of water come from? That\u2019s condensation! Cold surfaces can cause water vapor in the air to cool down, condense and form tiny beads of liquid. The molecules in these miniscule droplets of water are grouped far more closely together than when they were in their gas phase, and exert less pressure\u2014a fact that has some pretty cool physical implications.\n\nClaim: \nCondensation happens when the air is cooled to its dew point or it becomes so saturated with water vapor that it cannot hold any more water.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The amount of interest the banks collect on the loans is greater than the amount of interest they pay to customers with savings accounts\u2014and the difference is the banks\u2019 profit.\n\n\nFor example: You currently have an emergency fund of $10,000 in a high yield savings account that may pay 1.50% APY. The bank uses that money to fund someone\u2019s:\n\n\n* Mortgage at 5.50% APR\n* Student loan at 6.65% APR\n* Credit card at 16.99% APR\n\n\nYour bank may have paid you $150 in a year\u2019s time but they earned hundreds or thousands more from the interest on loans (made possible with your money). Now, think about this process repeated with millions of banking customers and billions of dollars. Yes, banks make a lot of money banks from charging borrowers interest, but the fees banks change are just as lucrative.\n\n\n* Account fees. Some typical financial products that charge fees are checking accounts, investment accounts, and credit cards. These fees are said to be for \u201cmaintenances purposes\u201d even though maintaining these accounts costs banks relatively little.\n* ATM fees. There will be times when you can\u2019t find your bank\u2019s ATM and you must settle for another ATM just to get some cash. Well, that\u2019s probably going to cost you $3. Such situations happen all the time and just mean more money for banks. * Penalty charges. Banks love to slap on a penalty fee for something a customer\u2019s mishaps. It could a credit card payment that you sent in at 5:05PM. It could be a check written for an amount that was one penny over what you had in your checking account. Whatever it may be, expect to pay a late fee or a notorious overdraft fee or between $25 and $40. It sucks for customers, but the banks are having a blast.\n* Commissions. Most banks will have investment divisions that often function as full-service brokerages. Of course, their commission fees for making trades are higher than most discount brokers.\n* Application fees. Whenever a prospective borrower applies for a loan (especially a home loan) many banks charge a loan origination or application fee. And, they can take the liberty of including this fee amount into the principal of your loan\u2014which means you\u2019ll pay interest on it too!

The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the \u2018trail\u2019, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.\n\nA new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable. A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance.\n\nClaim: \nThe new study in Science claims that the gyroscopic effects and trail of the bicycle do help its stability, but are not necessary above a certain speed.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

We probably don\u2019t think twice about buying something for $5.99 or $16.99, but it is a little strange when you think about it. Why aren\u2019t prices just even dollar amounts?

But there\u2019s really nothing \u201celaborate\u201d about it; it\u2019s actually pretty simple. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of psychological pricing,\u201d says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. \u201cBecause we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.\u201d This is especially effective if you\u2019re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices.

Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained. That's why shoppers are more likely to buy a product for $4.99 than an identical one for $5 the item that starts with a 4 just seems like a better deal than the one that starts with 5.\n\n\"We also tend to attempt to reduce the amount of effort expended on making product decisions, especially with lower-cost items,\" Hibbett told Life's Little Mysteries. \"So we may not really process the numbers after the dollar amount.\"\n\nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, according to the article \"Mind Your Pricing Cues,\" published in the September 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review. Price-conscious consumers have become conditioned to believe that they are getting a good deal when they buy something with a price ending in .99 even if the markdown is minimal.\n\nClaim: \nIt is a type of psychological pricing, where the .99 at the end of the price makes it seem like a better deal than a product with a price ending in .00.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

A positive number indicates farsightedness. A diopter designates how powerful a lens is needed to properly focus light on a person\u2019s retina. Many people have astigmatism in addition to myopia or hyperopia. In astigmatism, the cornea has a curvature imperfection, or the lens is distorted, resulting in both near and far objects appearing blurry.

But it\u2019s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or \u201cdiopter\u201d, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly.

Over time, this media becomes filled with dirt and debris, preventing the engine from breathing properly. As a result, the engine will work harder and use more fuel. One of the biggest reasons to change your air filter regularly. Some studies indicate that replacing a dirty air filter increases fuel mileage on older, carburated cars by as much as 14 percent if the filter is so dirty it affects driveability. In addition, changing a clogged air filter can potentially increase acceleration by 6 to 11 percent on modern fuel-injected cars. Other studies claim a 10 percent increase in gas mileage and up to 15\u00a2 per gallon fuel savings. Regardless of the exact figures, it is obvious that a clean air filter improves air flow to the engine and increases engine performance and gas mileage. When your air filter is dirty, your engine is forced to work harder, resulting in poor fuel economy, higher emissions and, possibly, a loss of engine power. In turn, as a worst-case scenario, a clogged cabin air filter can lead to under-performance of the A/C system, causing weak air flow from the cabin vents. It can also lead to unwanted, unfiltered air in the cabin. As for a mucked-up fuel filter, that\u2019ll land you with a weakened fuel supply to injectors, a reduction in engine power, poor acceleration and lousy fuel economy\u2014not to mention a potential breakdown.\n\nClaim: \nA vehicle's air filter can have a significant effect on its gas mileage.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

These alcohols are toxic, and may cause symptoms if swallowed in amounts greater than 30 milliliters. Taste and smell are separate senses with their own receptor organs, yet they are intimately entwined. Tastants, chemicals in foods, are detected by taste buds, which consist of special sensory cells. When stimulated, these cells send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants, airborne odor molecules. Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hairlike cilia at the tips of the sensory cells, a process that initiates a neural response. Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors of food. Airborne odor molecules, called odorants, are detected by specialized sensory neurons located in a small patch of mucus membrane lining the roof of the nose. Axons of these sensory cells pass through perforations in the overlying bone and enter two elongated olfactory bulbs lying against the underside of the frontal lobe of the brain. The senses of smell and taste combine at the back of the throat. When you taste something before you smell it, the smell lingers internally up to the nose causing you to smell it. Both smell and taste use chemoreceptors, which essentially means they are both sensing the chemical environment. This chemoreception in regards to taste, occurs via the presence of specialized taste receptors within the mouth that are referred to as taste cells and are bundled together to form taste buds. These taste buds, located in papillae which are found across the tongue, are specific for the five modalities: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami. These receptors are activated when their specific stimulus (i.e. sweet or salt molecules) is present and signals to the brain.\n\nClaim: \nThus, even though a fragrance may smell pleasant, it does not necessarily mean that it will taste good.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

A lot of what makes things taste weird when they\u2019re re-heated is that they\u2019re more dehydrated. Adding a bit of water or other moisture and sealing (for the oven) or slightly ventilating (for the microwave) helps in my experience. When fries are cooked at a very high temperature, the starches in them are hydrated (moisture goes in), puffing them up and helping the outer skin get nice and crisp. When these same fries cool, the starches secrete moisture, which makes its way to the fries\u2019 crust, leaving them soggy and limp. But the chemicals work some delicious magic, too. The flavor called umami, which you may know if you've watched enough Top Chef, is used to describe a food's savory flavor. And sometimes when food ages, this umami flavor will appear. It happens because, over time, proteins in food break down into amino acid chunks, and those chunks taste good. \"We're hardwired to associate their presence with healthfulness,\" says Loss. Raw rice contains traces of a bacterium known as Bacillus cereus. Unfortunately, this bacterium survives cooking, especially if the rice is cooked at or below 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) - as is the case if the rice is boiled in water. If the rice is then slowly cooled and stored at room temperature, the bacterium germinates, and might produce enterotoxins which in turn cause food poisoning.

A small amount of the increased clarity of vision is due to changing the shape of the eye as you squint. However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the \u201cpinhole effect\u201d. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as \u201cdepth of field\u201d. The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus. By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image. So, that means that squinting works by two mechanisms \u2013 by both changing the shape of the eye and by letting in light that can be focused more precisely by the lens.\n\nClaim: \nThe combination of these two mechanisms allows for a more focused image and better vision.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The phrase \u201cagnosticism\u201d was first used by Thomas Henry Huxley against religious people who accused him of denouncing the role of God in the creation of the universe. Huxley supported the theories of evolution by Charles Darwin and did not subscribe to religious beliefs. He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence. Huxley thought that agnosticism was a principle and not a belief. He reiterated that it is wrong for one to claim a phenomenon is a definite truth unless logical evidence is provided. The word was coined as the antagonist of the phrase \u201cGnosticism,\u201d meaning \u201cknowledge.\u201d Gnosticism was a religious ideology in the first and second centuries that suggested that the material world was ungodly while the spirit world was the better choice. Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God. He challenged the religious and atheists to prove or disprove the presence of God. \u201cMaybe there is a God, but maybe not. I\u2019m just not sure.

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions. Of the 15 industries employing the greatest percentage of foreign-born workers, half are low-wage service industries, including gardening, domestic household work, car washes, shoe repair and janitorial work. A recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\" First, many immigrants send portions of their income out of the domestic economy in the form of remittances, but it is hard to know if this is materially different from domestic purchase of imports, and besides, ultimately those cash flows circulate back to demand for U.S. goods in the form of exports. Second, migrants are paid their marginal product (as is any worker), meaning that much if not most of their value added to production directly benefits the native population.\n\nClaim: \nHowever, there are certain factors that may contribute to the discrepancy between the impact of immigration on wages in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The processor captures sound signals and sends them to a receiver implanted under the skin behind the ear. The receiver sends the signals to electrodes implanted in the snail-shaped inner ear (cochlea).\n\n\nThe signals stimulate the auditory nerve, which then directs them to the brain. The brain interprets those signals as sounds, though these sounds won't be just like normal hearing.\n\n\nIt takes time and training to learn to interpret the signals received from a cochlear implant. Within a year of use, most people with cochlear implants make considerable gains in understanding speech. Though the brain will notice the sounds, they\u2019re not the same as normal hearing. Speech therapy and rehabilitation are necessary to learn how to properly interpret these sounds.\n\nClaim: \nEven after they\u2019ve had the implant and gone through the training and rehabilitation process, they won\u2019t necessarily understand speech the same way someone born hearing would.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Here, we are using the bearing to objects to determine position of points along the coastline. Still, it works much the same way.\n\n\nMaps - especially of shorelines - were almost certainly made from observations taken from boats. Naval navigation is much more accurate than navigation on land (especially without good maps!). Prior to the mid-1700's, the primary means of navigation was dead reckoning (DR). This requires that you iteratively advance your position on the map from your last known position using direction and time/distance. Of course, over time, errors will compound resulting in reduced accuracy. You must have a way of measuring your direction of travel and a (somewhat) accurate value for your speed.\n\n\nLater in the 1700's, it was possible to navigate more accurately using celestial navigation. This allowed a skilled navigator to determine his position rather accurately (typically within a few miles) at any point on the globe. The position was typically found once each day and advanced using DR as necessary. The topics of navigation and cartography are two sides of the same coin, and there are entire books written about each. It is interesting to study the history of cartography because it very graphically shows the corresponding improvements in navigation over time.\n\n\nIn order to make an accurate map, you need to know first where you are making your observations from. Making the observations from a previously known position will result in much greater accuracy. This position may have been established by an earlier survey (eg, working from a known point on an existing map) or by being able to independently figure out your position with good certainty on the position of the globe. The problem was the portolan mapmakers\u2019 lack of a systematic way of reducing the spherical Earth to a flat map. That was of little consequence for short journeys but mattered much more when sailing longer distances. In 1569, the Belgian geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator created his method for presenting a spherical world on a flat map, the one familiar to us today. This mapmaking technique, though it stretched and compressed landmarks and distances between them, had the great advantage that a straight compass course was represented by a straight line on the map.\n\n\nMercator\u2019s projections began to be used to sail the open seas by the early 1800s, by which time portolan charts had pretty much disappeared. But their importance is undeniable. \u201cThe development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,\u201d Hessler says. \u201cUnderstanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nClaim: \nThis allowed for much more accurate navigation than dead reckoning.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

For example, A 10 megapixel (MP) camera may provide settings to take pictures in 10.2 MP (3872 x 2592), 5.6 MP (2896 x 1944), and 2.5 MP (1936 x 1296). A higher image size setting means a larger picture and bigger file size. A lower image size setting makes a smaller picture and smaller file size. Depending on your camera, there may be different sizes available.\n\n\nFile size: This is the amount of space that the image file takes up on your memory card, or internal memory if your camera has one. It is measured in megabytes. The actual file size depends on the image size and image quality settings selected on the camera.\n\n\nImage quality: This dictates how much compression is used to record the file information. Some digital cameras have a Fine and Standard setting where the Fine setting uses less compression than the Standard setting. Therefore, the detail of a picture taken with the Fine setting is a sharper than one taken with the Standard setting. Similar to the image size setting discussed above, this also affects the file size. Since the Fine setting uses less compression and records more detail, the file size will be larger than one recorded with the standard setting. Compression is the process of reducing the size of a file. It is achieved by encoding the file in an efficient way, allowing it to be smaller. If each pixel is defined using 8 bits of color information, then the file is eight times bigger than a black-and-white bitmap. Similarly, a 24-bit file is a full three times bigger than the 8-bit image, and a 48-bit file is twice the size of a 24-bit one. Color depth is the number of colors that can be used for each pixel on the display. This can range from 8- bit color, 16-bit high color to 24-bit true color. The range of color is determined by how many bits of red, green and blue (RGB) each pixel is assigned to the frame buffer.\n\nClaim: \nHigher image quality settings use less compression and thus create a larger file size.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth\u2019s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun\u2019s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells \u2013skin, blood, bone \u2013 which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job. Some cells were tasked with making junctions to hold the group together, while other cells made digestive enzymes that could break down food.\n\n## The First Animals\n\nThese clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago\n\nClaim: \nThese microbes eventually evolved into eukaryotic cells, which contain organelles and nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Virtually all natural water you deal with is oxygenated to some extent. As the water freezes, it wants to form a regular crystalline structure (ice). That means impurities like oxygen and other dissolved gasses are pushed away from the crystallization front into the remaining liquid. This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you\u2019ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you\u2019ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That\u2019s because those were the last parts to freeze. The ice cubes in your tray froze from the top downward, which pushed the contaminant air downward until it was trapped at the bottom and had nowhere else to go. The most common impurities found in tap water include lime (also known as limescale), calcium, fluoride, nitrates, magnesium and certain other organic elements that are practically impossible to remove with regular filtration methods. So, when water freezes, the impurities that were evenly distributed in the water, tend to congregate near the middle, making ice cubes the whitest at their center. The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.\n\n\nBecause all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify.

Some people lack the ability to detect the odor simply because of genetic variations. The main culprit is aspargusic acid, which is found exclusively in asparagus. When asparagus is digested, asparagusic acid gets broken down into sulfur containing byproducts. Sulfur, in general, is not very pleasant to smell, notes Dr. Bobart. When you pee, the sulfur byproducts evaporate almost immediately, causing you to smell that unpleasant scent. The asparagusic acid in asparagus produces many sulfurous byproducts that give your pee a rotten-like smell.\n\n\nThe smell can be detected as early as 15 minutes after eating asparagus and may last up to 14 hours. One study in 6,909 adults noted that 58% of men and 62% of women had asparagus anosmia, suggesting that this specific genetic modification is quite common Researchers believe that, during digestion, the vegetable's sulfurous amino acids break down into smelly chemical components in all people.

The number of earthquakes is increasing in regions with active unconventional oil and gas wells, where water pumped at high pressure breaks open rock containing natural gas, leaving behind wastewater in need of disposing.

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions. Of the 15 industries employing the greatest percentage of foreign-born workers, half are low-wage service industries, including gardening, domestic household work, car washes, shoe repair and janitorial work. A recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\" First, many immigrants send portions of their income out of the domestic economy in the form of remittances, but it is hard to know if this is materially different from domestic purchase of imports, and besides, ultimately those cash flows circulate back to demand for U.S. goods in the form of exports.

A variety of different cogs, gears and bearings must engage with each other in order to work, and transmission fluid is essential to lubricate those parts. Without the fluid, the vehicle would suffer from an excessive amount of wear and tear, and you would need to replace those internal parts frequently. Yet the automatic transmission is very different from the manual in many respects. It's not possible, therefore, to use a fluid that was designed for a manual transmission in an automatic variant. The automatic transmission fluid is also designed to be pressurised so it can activate the various clutches and other internal parts that change your gears automatically. It is typically synthesised so that it will work under high pressure and temperature situations, and is far less likely to break down or oxidise. Nevertheless, even though the fluid is quite sophisticated, there's only so much that it can do, and an element of wear and tear is inevitable. Tiny specks of metal will eventually grind away and will float within the fluid. Some of this debris will be caught by filters, but it'll nevertheless build up over time and affect the consistency of the fluid. As the months go by, the automatic transmission fluid will be less capable of protecting those internal parts. It may not perform so well when pressurised, either, and this could adversely affect vehicle performance. Manufacturers recommend, therefore, that you take the vehicle in for an automatic transmission service at predetermined intervals. Automatic transmissions (wet clutches) require hydrodynamic clutches, torque converters and wet brakes. Due to the function-related fluid losses, these always require low-viscosity, mildly additivated gear lubrication with a high oxidation stability. In order to reduce fuel consumption ATFs must have lower viscosities while at the same time maintaining protection for gears and bearings despite the lower lubricant film thickness.\n\nClaim: \nHowever, as the fluid is used over time, tiny specks of metal will eventually grind away and float within the fluid, which can affect the consistency of the fluid.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Virtually all natural water you deal with is oxygenated to some extent. As the water freezes, it wants to form a regular crystalline structure (ice). That means impurities like oxygen and other dissolved gasses are pushed away from the crystallization front into the remaining liquid. This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you\u2019ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you\u2019ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That\u2019s because those were the last parts to freeze. The ice cubes in your tray froze from the top downward, which pushed the contaminant air downward until it was trapped at the bottom and had nowhere else to go. The most common impurities found in tap water include lime (also known as limescale), calcium, fluoride, nitrates, magnesium and certain other organic elements that are practically impossible to remove with regular filtration methods. So, when water freezes, the impurities that were evenly distributed in the water, tend to congregate near the middle, making ice cubes the whitest at their center. The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.\n\n\nBecause all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify. Water free of minerals and impurities freezes first, pushing the cloudy parts containing the sediment (and tiny trapped air bubbles) toward the center.

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions. Of the 15 industries employing the greatest percentage of foreign-born workers, half are low-wage service industries, including gardening, domestic household work, car washes, shoe repair and janitorial work. A recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\" First, many immigrants send portions of their income out of the domestic economy in the form of remittances, but it is hard to know if this is materially different from domestic purchase of imports, and besides, ultimately those cash flows circulate back to demand for U.S. goods in the form of exports. Second, migrants are paid their marginal product (as is any worker), meaning that much if not most of their value added to production directly benefits the native population.\n\nClaim: \nThe debate over the effect of immigration on wages is a complicated one, as economists use different empirical methods to measure the impact of immigration on wages.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

This is because the solid construction of the tires makes the tires have no medium to absorb shocks.\n\nSo that the solid rubber tire is not suitable for use in passenger cars that prioritize comfort.\n\nApart from that, there are other disadvantages. Tires made of solid rubber have a higher weight than pneumatic tires. The higher weight will increase the engine load to run the vehicle.\n\nSo that if a solid rubber tire is used in a passenger car, the car accelerates slowly and wastes fuel.\n\nFrom this, it can be concluded that solid rubber is not suitable for use in vehicles operating on the road. The air in the tires can often absorb impact of a hole or bump because of it\u2019s high suspension capabilities. On airless tires, the suspension would be lower, resulting in a rougher ride.

Due to this, whenever particles collide, they may move in any direction, but all the up and down motion cancels out, always following the rule that the total spin in that plane must be constant. This is due to a rule known as the conservation of angular momentum \u2013 the total amount of spinning in any isolated system, such as the Solar System, will always remain constant. This allowed the cloud to flatten over time, losing its height and becoming the roughly two-dimensional disc we see today. As the particles bump into each other, all the up and down motion tends to cancel out, it's energy lost in crashing and clumping. Yet, the whole mass must continue spinning, inexorably, because in our universe, the total amount of spinning in any isolated system always stays the same.

Because of this, and due to the fact that we use metal for conductors, the physical strength of a standard power cable will be significantly higher than that of a video cable connector. Furthermore, it's much easier to damage the tiny pins on a VGA/DVI connector, whereas I'm sure most people would agree it's much harder to bend/twist a power connector (save for stepping on the thing).\n\n\nIndeed, this is also the reason why many of these connectors still 'screw' into things. Of course it's not a huge deal if the cable falls out of the computer, which is also why you don't have to use the screws if you don't want to. However, it's usually safer to use them to prevent accidental disconnection (saves you the headache of checking behind your computer every time your monitor blanks out), and indeed, a typical VGA/DVI connector lacks the physical holding pressure a standard USB connector does. The more HDMI ports your TV has, the merrier, since HDMI is showing up on all types of souce components. However, if you've set up a home theater sound system, the receiver is likely to have multiple HDMI inputs, and by switching your source in the receiver, one HDMI input on your TV should serve your day-to-day needs.

A higher image size setting means a larger picture and bigger file size. A lower image size setting makes a smaller picture and smaller file size. Depending on your camera, there may be different sizes available.\n\n\nFile size: This is the amount of space that the image file takes up on your memory card, or internal memory if your camera has one. It is measured in megabytes. The actual file size depends on the image size and image quality settings selected on the camera.\n\n\nImage quality: This dictates how much compression is used to record the file information. Some digital cameras have a Fine and Standard setting where the Fine setting uses less compression than the Standard setting. Therefore, the detail of a picture taken with the Fine setting is a sharper than one taken with the Standard setting. Similar to the image size setting discussed above, this also affects the file size. Since the Fine setting uses less compression and records more detail, the file size will be larger than one recorded with the standard setting. Compression is the process of reducing the size of a file. It is achieved by encoding the file in an efficient way, allowing it to be smaller. If each pixel is defined using 8 bits of color information, then the file is eight times bigger than a black-and-white bitmap. Similarly, a 24-bit file is a full three times bigger than the 8-bit image, and a 48-bit file is twice the size of a 24-bit one. Color depth is the number of colors that can be used for each pixel on the display. This can range from 8- bit color, 16-bit high color to 24-bit true color. The range of color is determined by how many bits of red, green and blue (RGB) each pixel is assigned to the frame buffer.\n\nClaim: \nThe image quality setting dictates how much compression is used to encode the file and thus affects the file size.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The new complex cells (\u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job. Some cells were tasked with making junctions to hold the group together, while other cells made digestive enzymes that could break down food.\n\n## The First Animals\n\nThese clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago\n\nClaim: \nNatural selection is the process by which the traits of an organism become more or less common in a population over time, depending on how well they help the organism survive and reproduce.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

The stock market works through a network of exchanges \u2014 you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.

A positive number indicates farsightedness. A diopter designates how powerful a lens is needed to properly focus light on a person\u2019s retina. Many people have astigmatism in addition to myopia or hyperopia. In astigmatism, the cornea has a curvature imperfection, or the lens is distorted, resulting in both near and far objects appearing blurry. Reading lenses are rated in diopters, a formula opticians use. Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it\u2019s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or \u201cdiopter\u201d, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range. In contrast, if you are working at your desk and your computer monitor is 24 inches away, you will need a weaker power than you would for reading.\n\nClaim: \nTherefore, putting on glasses from someone with a dioptry will not make you see like they do without them.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no"}]}

Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second, when they are under a second. Slow shutter speeds allow more light into the camera sensor and are used for low-light and night photography, while fast shutter speeds help to freeze motion. Aperture \u2013 a hole within a lens, through which light travels into the camera body. The larger the hole, the more light passes to the camera sensor. Aperture also controls the depth of field, which is the portion of a scene that appears to be sharp. If the aperture is very small, the depth of field is large changing aperture also changes depth of field, while changing shutter speed alters the appearance of moving objects. In other words, you can also adjust aperture for depth of field or shutter speed to produce the effect of motion.\n\nClaim: \nThe larger the hole, the more light passes to the camera sensor, and it also determines the depth of field, which is the portion of a scene that appears to be sharp.\n\nPlease assess the claim\u2019s consistency with the document by responding with either \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}
